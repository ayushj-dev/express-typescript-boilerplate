# Express Typescript Boilerplate

This is a ready to use express app skeleton integrated with typescript.

> NOTE:
> - This project uses class based architecture.
> - Never push .env files in real world projects, this is a boilerplate.
> - The methods in controllers are arrow functions. This is intentional since we are injecting service as a dependency and we want to preserve this binding. Make sure to use arrow functions for methods in controllers.

## Before you start
- Make sure to install valkey on your system as per your OS from - https://valkey.io/download/
